Here are the precise instructions for coding a backtest for the Larry Williams Volatility Breakout Strategy:

1. Data Requirements:
    - Historical price data (OHLC) with a five-minute timeframe.
    - Volume data for the corresponding time periods.

2. Indicator Setup:
    - Donchian Channels with the length set to 96 periods; use the high and low for the respective upper and lower bands and the average for the middle band.
    - Larry Williams' Trade Index (LWTI) with the period set to 25 and smoothing period set to 20.
    - Volume indicator with a moving average over 30 periods (volume MA).

3. Long Entry Conditions:
    - Price touches or breaks above the Donchian upper band (red line).
    - The LWTI indicator must be green at the time of the breakout.
    - Volume bars must be above the white volume MA line and must also be green.
    - All entry conditions must be met simultaneously.

4. Long Stop Loss and Take Profit:
    - Stop loss can generally be placed below the middle orange line (mean) of the Donchian Channels.
    - In cases where the middle line is far from the upper band (creating a large potential stop loss), use the recent swing low as the stop loss instead.
    - Set the take profit with a 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio relative to the stop loss.

5. Short Entry Conditions:
    - Price touches or breaks below the Donchian lower band (red line).
    - The LWTI indicator must be red at the time of the breakout.
    - Volume bars must be above the white volume MA line and must also be red.
    - All entry conditions must be met simultaneously.

6. Short Stop Loss and Take Profit:
    - Stop loss can generally be placed above the middle orange line (mean) of the Donchian Channels.
    - In cases where the middle line is far from the lower band (creating a large potential stop loss), use the recent swing high as the stop loss instead.
    - Set the take profit with a 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio relative to the stop loss.

7. Additional Filters:
    - Avoid entering trades when the price is near major support or resistance levels identified on a higher timeframe (such as 1 hour).
    - Skip trades that fulfill entry conditions but are too close to identified major levels.
    - Consider entering a trade if the price is breaking through a resistance/support level and all other indicator conditions are met.

8. Backtest Procedure:
    - Iterate through historical 5-minute data.
    - Check for entry signals based on conditions detailed above.
    - When a signal is generated, enter the trade with the defined stop loss and take profit levels.
    - Record the trade outcome (win, loss, or break-even) and the respective profit or loss based on the price when the stop loss or take profit levels are hit.
    - Account for spreads or trading costs if applicable.
    - Compile the results to calculate metrics such as win rate, risk-reward ratio, average gain/loss, drawdown, and overall profitability.

9. Backtest Outputs:
    - Equity curve over the testing period.
    - A detailed trade log with entry and exit points, stop loss, take profit, and trade outcome.
    - Summary statistics including total number of trades, win rate, average win/average loss, maximum drawdown, net profit, and profit factor.
