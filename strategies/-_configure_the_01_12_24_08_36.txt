Trading Strategy Instructions:

1. **Indicator Setup:**
   - Add the 'Imbalance Algo' by Imba Trading as the primary indicator.
   - Set up the 'Imbalance Algo' to use Fibonacci retracement levels of 0.236 for long entry and 0.786 for short entry.
   - Configure the 'Imbalance Algo' for the desired time frame (15-minute recommended for Solana as per the example).
   - Add a second indicator named 'Trend Strength Over Time' by the specified creator for trend confirmation.
   - The 'Trend Strength Over Time' oscillator should be configured to read above zero for confirming long entries and below zero for confirming short entries.

2. **Entry Criteria:**
   - **Long Entry:** A buy signal is generated when one candle closes above the 0.236 Fibonacci level, the 'Imbalance Algo' band is green, and the 'Trend Strength Over Time' oscillator is above zero simultaneously.
   - **Short Entry:** A sell signal is generated when one candle closes below the 0.786 Fibonacci level, the 'Imbalance Algo' band is red, and the 'Trend Strength Over Time' oscillator is below zero simultaneously.

3. **Stop Loss and Take Profit:**
   - A predefined risk percentage per trade should be set between 1% to 2% of the trading account balance.
   - Initial stop loss should be set at the level indicated by the 'Imbalance Algo' (at the red line for a sell signal, for instance).
   - Take profit levels should be set with the option to take partial profits. For example, take off 40% of the position at TP1 and adjust the stop loss to the break-even price, then take off another 30% at TP2 and adjust the stop loss to the previous target. Continue this strategy for further take profit levels.

4. **Trade Management:**
   - If the first take profit target is reached, move the stop loss to the entry price to ensure a break-even outcome as a minimum.
   - With further movement in the trade's favor, adjust the stop loss to each successful take profit level as it is reached.

5. **Trade Exit:**
   - The position should be exited entirely either when the stop loss is hit or when all predetermined take profit levels are reached.

6. **Backtesting Parameters:**
   - Include an option to adjust the initial account balance to the planned trading amount.
   - Include a backtest panel in the strategy to dynamically view performance metrics such as win ratio, number of closed trades, winning and losing streaks, account balance, and total profit in percentage terms.

7. **Indicator Parameters:**
   - Ensure the 'Imbalance Algo' signal sensitivity is adjustable, with a recommended setting of 15 for Solana on a 15-minute time frame.
   - Provide customization options for the stop loss strategy (fixed or volatility-based) and the take profit strategy (fixed percentage or incremental).

Remember, these instructions are for another AI to code a backtest, so precise definitions and parameters are essential to replicate the strategy accurately.
