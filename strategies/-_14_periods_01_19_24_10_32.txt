Trading Strategy Instructions:

**Strategy Name:**
Multi-Indicator Crossover Strategy

**Objective:**
To generate buy and sell signals based on the Money Flow Index (MFI), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover indicators.

**Indicators:**

1. Money Flow Index (MFI) - 14 periods
2. Relative Strength Index (RSI) - 14 periods
3. Short-Term Simple Moving Average (SMA) - 50 periods
4. Long-Term Simple Moving Average (SMA) - 200 periods

**Buy Conditions (All conditions must be met):**

1. MFI Buy Signal:
   - The MFI crosses above the 20 level, indicating a move from oversold conditions.

2. RSI Buy Signal:
   - The RSI crosses above the 30 level, confirming the move out of oversold territory.

3. SMA Crossover Buy Signal:
   - The short-term SMA (50 periods) crosses above the long-term SMA (200 periods), indicating a potential upward trend.

**Sell Condition (Only one condition needs to be met):**

1. SMA Crossover Sell Signal:
   - The short-term SMA (50 periods) crosses below the long-term SMA (200 periods), indicating a potential downward trend.

**Trade Execution:**

- Execute a Buy order when all three buy conditions are met simultaneously at the close of a trading period.
- Execute a Sell order when the sell condition is met at the close of a trading period.

**Position Sizing:**
- Position sizing can be dynamically determined based on risk management rules which are not included in the scope of this set of instructions.

**Stop Loss and Take Profit:**

- These should be determined based on volatility, average true range (ATR), or risk tolerance thresholds but are not provided in the strategy instructions.

**Backtest Considerations:**

- Data Frequency: The strategy should be tested on daily timeframes.
- Historical Data Range: Should be tested on a sufficient length of historical data for statistical significance (e.g., 5+ years).
- Commissions and Slippage: These should be factored into the backtest to ensure realistic trade execution scenarios.
- Risk Management: Include a mechanism to quantify risk per trade and overall portfolio risk.
- Drawdown: Monitor the maximum drawdown of the portfolio to understand potential capital at risk.

**Output Metrics for Backtest:**

- Total Return
- Annualized Return
- Maximum Drawdown
- Sharpe Ratio
- Sortino Ratio
- Win Rate
- Average Win to Average Loss Ratio
- Number of Trades
- Longest Drawdown Duration
