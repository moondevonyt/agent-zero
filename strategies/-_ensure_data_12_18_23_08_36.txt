Trading Strategy Instructions based on "A combined approach of complex network and multiscale fractal dimension for stock time series analysis"

1. Data Preprocessing:
    - Collect historical price data for the asset to be traded (daily closing prices are suggested).
    - Ensure data is clean and has no missing values.
    - Normalize the time series data through min-max normalization or any suitable method.

2. Construct Visibility Graph:
    - Convert the normalized time series data into a visibility graph, as per the methodology described in the paper.
    - Each data point in the time series will be a node in the graph.
    - An edge between two nodes is created if they are 'mutually visible' based on geometric visibility criterion provided in the paper.

3. Compute Degree Sequence:
    - Calculate the degree of each node in the visibility graph.
    - The degree sequence is the list of degrees of all nodes in the graph.

4. Multiscale Fractal Dimension (MFDFA):
    - Perform Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) on the original normalized time series.
    - Calculate the generalized Hurst exponent (H(q)) and the multifractality spectrum (f(Î±)) from the MFDFA results.

5. Combining Network Metrics and MFDFA:
    - Analyze the network's topology using the degree sequence.
    - Investigate the multifractality of the time series using results from the MFDFA.
    - Look for critical points in the fractality spectrum or significant changes in the network metrics which may indicate a change in market regime.

6. Trading Signals:
    - Define thresholds for significant changes based on historical data analysis (e.g., deviations beyond a certain percentile of observed values in the degree sequence or changes in the Hurst exponent).
    - A Buy signal is generated when:
        a) There is a sudden drop in the network's mean or median degree value, indicating a possible downward movement followed by a reversal.
        b) The Hurst exponent approaches 0.5 from below, suggesting a transition to a more efficient market phase.
    - A Sell signal is generated when:
        a) There is a sudden rise in the network's mean or median degree value, indicating a possible upward movement followed by a correction.
        b) The Hurst exponent approaches 0.5 from above, suggesting a transition to a less efficient market phase.

7. Position Management and Exit Strategy:
    - Establish criteria for taking profits and cutting losses (e.g., a target return percentage or a stop-loss percentage).
    - Create rules for position sizing based on the confidence level of signals (e.g., stronger signals get a higher allocation).

8. Risk Management:
    - Set a maximum exposure level for open trades to manage risk.
    - Diversify across different assets if applicable.

9. Backtesting Protocol:
    - Use historical data to backtest the trading strategy.
    - Record trades, including entry points, exit points, position sizes, and results.
    - Analyze the performance metrics such as Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, win rate, and profit factor.

10. Optimization:
    - Optimize the strategy parameters using the backtesting results.
    - Identify the best-performing parameters in terms of risk-reward profile.

11. Validation:
    - Validate the strategy on out-of-sample data to test for overfitting.
    - Compare the strategy's performance to a relevant benchmark.

Always remember to follow ethical trading practices and ensure your strategy complies with the relevant regulatory standards.
