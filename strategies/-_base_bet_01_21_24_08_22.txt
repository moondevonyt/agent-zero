Trading Strategy: Profitable Martingale System

Objective:
Implement a modified Martingale trading strategy that increases position size after a profitable trade rather than after a loss, attempting to capitalize on streaks of winning trades.

Initial Requirements:
- Starting capital: user-defined
- Base bet size: a fixed percentage of current capital or a fixed amount
- Maximum bet size: user-defined or based on a multiplier of the base bet size
- Win condition: user-defined criteria (e.g., crossover of certain moving averages, breakout from range, etc.)
- Bet increase factor: the multiplier by which to increase the bet size after a profitable trade (e.g., 2x, 1.5x, etc.)
- Maximum number of increases: after how many consecutive profitable trades to stop increasing the bet size and reset to the base bet size
- Stop-Loss/Take-Profit: user-defined stop-loss and take-profit levels

Entry:
1. Account Balance: Calculate initial account balance.
2. Base Bet Size: Determine the base bet size, either a fixed amount or a certain percentage of the current account balance.
3. Signal for Entry: Monitor financial instruments for the predetermined win condition.
4. Open Position: Enter a trade with the determined base bet size when the win condition is met.

Money Management:
1. Profitable Trade:
   a. After a profitable trade, multiply the bet size by the bet increase factor.
   b. If the number of consecutive profitable trades reaches the maximum number of increases, reset the bet size to the base bet size.
2. Losing Trade:
   a. After a losing trade, reset the bet size to the base bet size.
3. Maximum Bet Size: Ensure the bet size does not exceed the user-defined maximum bet size after any increases. If the calculated next bet size exceeds this limit, use the maximum bet size instead.
4. Risk Management: Apply a stop-loss and a take-profit to each trade to manage risk.

Exit:
1. Stop-Loss or Take-Profit Hit: Close the position if the price hits the stop-loss or the take-profit.
2. Signal for Exit: If the strategy includes a signal for exit (other than stop-loss or take-profit), close the trade when the condition is satisfied.

Result Evaluation:
1. After closing the trade, determine whether it was profitable.
2. Update the account balance with the result of the closed trade. If profitable, calculate the next bet size using the bet increase factor; if not, revert to the base bet size for the next trade.

Strategy Reset:
1. Reset Conditions: The strategy resets to the base bet size under two conditions:
   a. After a losing trade.
   b. After reaching the maximum number of consecutive increases following profitable trades.

Reporting:
Throughout the backtest, keep track of the following metrics:
- Total number of trades
- Win rate (percentage of profitable trades)
- Average win and average loss
- Maximum drawdown (the largest peak-to-trough decline in account balance)
- Net profit or loss
- Return on investment (ROI)

After executing the backtest based on these instructions, the AI should produce a report containing these performance metrics and a chart of the equity curve for the strategy over the backtest period.
