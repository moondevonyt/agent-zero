Strategy Name: Breakout-Funding Rate Arbitrage Strategy

Objective: Capitalize on market breakouts while using funding rate disparities as an additional signal for positioning in perpetual futures markets.

Financial Instruments: Perpetual Futures Contracts on Cryptocurrency assets

Strategy Outline:

1. Define Parameters:
   - Breakout Lookback Period (`BLP`): The number of past periods to consider for identifying a breakout (e.g., number of days, hours).
   - Breakout Threshold (`BT`): The percentage increase (for bullish) or decrease (for bearish) in price from the previous `BLP` to define a breakout.
   - Funding Rate Lookback Period (`FRP`): The number of past funding periods to consider for calculating the average funding rate.
   - Funding Rate Threshold (`FRT`): The minimum absolute difference between the current funding rate and the average funding rate calculated over `FRP`.
   - Position Size (`PS`): The size of each trade as a percentage of the portfolio.

2. Data Collection:
   - Procure historical and real-time price data for the chosen cryptocurrency perpetual futures contracts for the `BLP`.
   - Procure historical and real-time funding rate data for the same contracts for the `FRP`.

3. Breakout Conditions:
   - Bullish Breakout: If the current price is greater than the highest price in the last `BLP` by at least `BT%`.
   - Bearish Breakout: If the current price is less than the lowest price in the last `BLP` by at least `BT%`.

4. Funding Rate Conditions:
   - Above-Average Funding: If the current funding rate is greater than the average funding rate over the `FRP` by at least `FRT`.
   - Below-Average Funding: If the current funding rate is less than the average funding rate over the `FRP` by at least `FRT`.

5. Trading Logic:
   - If a Bullish Breakout is detected and the funding rate is Below-Average, enter a Long position with `PS` of the portfolio.
   - If a Bearish Breakout is detected and the funding rate is Above-Average, enter a Short position with `PS` of the portfolio.

6. Position Management:
   - Stop Loss (`SL`): A percentage below/above the entry price for Long/Short positions to limit losses.
   - Take Profit (`TP`): A percentage above/below the entry price for Long/Short positions to realize gains.
   - The exact `SL` and `TP` levels will be predefined based on historical volatility and backtesting outcomes.

7. Exit Conditions:
   - Close the position if the price hits the Stop Loss or Take Profit levels.
   - Alternatively, close the position if there is a reversal in the breakout direction (e.g., new Bearish Breakout during a Long position).

8. Risk Management:
   - Only one position should be open at any given time.
   - Adjust `PS` dynamically to meet predefined risk management rules, such as maximum drawdown limits.

Instructions for AI to Code The Backtest:

1. Gather historical data for both price and funding rates of selected cryptocurrency perpetual futures contracts over a significant enough period to include various market conditions.
   
2. Calculate the highest/lowest price for `BLP` and average funding rate for `FRP` for the entire dataset at each time step required for trade decisions.

3. Implement the trading logic by iterating through the data:
   - Detect breakouts according to the `BT%` definition in relation to the past `BLP`.
   - Compare the current funding rate to the average funding rate over the `FRP` using the `FRT` and identify the condition (Above-Average or Below-Average).

4. Simulate trades following the trading logic and position management rules:
   - Enter Long positions on Bullish Breakouts with Below-Average Funding Rates according to the `PS` rule.
   - Enter Short positions on Bearish Breakouts with Above-Average Funding Rates according to the `PS` rule.
   - Implement Stop Loss and Take Profit mechanisms.

5. Apply the exit conditions to close positions as specified.

6. Track performance metrics such as net profit, maximum drawdown, win rate, and Sharpe ratio to evaluate the strategy's effectiveness.

7. Use the collected metrics to refine the strategy parameters (such as `BLP`, `BT`, `FRP`, `FRT`, `PS`, `SL`, `TP`) through optimization methods if necessary.

This provided outline requires the subsequent AI to develop a backtest that strictly adheres to the described rules. It should account for transaction costs, slippage, and any other realistic trading constraints to ensure the strategy's applicability in a live market environment.
